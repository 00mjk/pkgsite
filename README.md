# Pkg.go.dev

[Pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev) is a website for discovering and evaluting Go
packages and modules.

## Roadmap

Pkg.go.dev [launched](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/OW8bHSryLIc)
in November 2019, and is currently under active development by the Go team.

Our current goal is to work on addressing the
[UX feedback](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ago.dev+label%3AUX)
we have received. You can expect pkg.go.dev to be slated for some design
changes coming soon. We plan to share these designs for feedback with everyone
once they are ready.

Longer term, we are working towards redirecting godoc.org traffic to
pkg.go.dev. We want to ensure that we address users' needs in the process. Read more
about our [next steps for pkg.go.dev](https://blog.golang.org/pkg.go.dev-2020).
Issues related to redirecting godoc.org traffic are being tracked
in [Go issue #39144](https://golang.org/issue/39144).
We plan to address these issues before redirecting traffic from godoc.org to
pkg.go.dev.

We encourage everyone to begin using pkg.go.dev today for all of their needs
and [file feedback](https://golang.org/s/discovery-feedback)! You can redirect
all of your requests from godoc.org to pkg.go.dev, by clicking `Always use
pkg.go.dev` at the top of any page on godoc.org.

If you are having issues with pkg.go.dev, please first check the known issues
before following the troubleshooting guide. If that does not give you the
information you need, reach out to us.
