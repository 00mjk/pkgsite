# Pkg.go.dev

[Pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev) is a website for discovering and evaluting Go packages and modules.

## Roadmap

Pkg.go.dev [launched](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/OW8bHSryLIc)
in November 2019, and is currently under active development by the Go team.

Our current goal is to work towards redirecting godoc.org traffic to
pkg.go.dev, and ensure that we address users' needs in the process. Read more
about our [plans for pkg.go.dev in 2020](https://blog.golang.org/pkg.go.dev-2020).

We encourage everyone to begin using pkg.go.dev today for all of their needs
and [file feedback](https://golang.org/s/discovery-feedback)! You can redirect
all of your requests from godoc.org to pkg.go.dev, by visiting
[godoc.org/?redirect=on](https://godoc.org/?redirect=on).
Details at [Go issue #37099](http://golang.org/issue/37099).

If you are having issues with pkg.go.dev, please first check the known issues
before following the troubleshooting guide. If that does not give you the
information you need, reach out to us.
